# Breast_Cancer_Detection
My Machine learning project aims to predict the diagnosis of breast cancer using a Random Forest Classifier. By analyzing features extracted from digitized images of cell nuclei, the model achieved an accuracy of approximately 95.61% on the test set. This project holds promise for assisting medical professionals in early detection and diagnosis, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes.
